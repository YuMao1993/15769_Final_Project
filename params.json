Accelerating SIFT feature correspondence search with fast adaptive approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search based on [2].\r\n\r\n2. Implementing functionality to support multiple users contributing to the 3D reconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf time permits, we will further investigate global optimizations in the presence of multiple user input streams.\r\n\r\nFor purpose of learning, we will rewrite the two modules from scratch.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Challenges\r\n\r\n1. SIFT features of a new frame need to be matched with all previously seen frames, even in the presence of multiple user input streams.\r\n\r\n2. Efficiently handling concurrent update to a global 3D model while reducing synchronization overhead.\r\n\r\n3. Accelerating relocalization if there are multiple users.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Resources \r\n\r\n+ **Data set**: RGB-D Scanning data from [3]\r\n+ **Machine**: a cluster of GPU nodes\r\n+ **Code**: We will be working based on BundleFusion's source code [3]. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Goals & Deliverable\r\n\r\nThe goal of our project is to deliver an improved BundleFusion system that can handle multiple users 3D reconstruction in real time.\r\n\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n[[1] Muja, Marius, and David G.
